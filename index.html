<a HREF="resume.html"> Resume </a>



<p>Hello World!</p>

<p>I am from Sebago, Maine. In high school I played soccer, baseball, and track and field. 
I love to hang out with my friends from back home, play sports, and go fishing. 
I also enjoy playing video games, more specifically sports games.
I live in Cumberland Hall, and I am glad that I decided to the University of Maine, 
although I do miss my Yellow Lab named Cooper. This past summer, I worked at Point Sebago 
Resort, where I was an activities counselor. The summer before that, I worked for 
Lakes Environmental Association (LEA) as a boat inspector, where I inspected boats for 
invasive plants such as milfoil. </p>
